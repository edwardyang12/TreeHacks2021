We blame President Obama for our problems and many see Romney as a way out . Is this a fog , do international perspectives recognize the problem as bigger than a '' `` leader '' '' so to speak ? Rather than seeing the leader as a solution , do they see things more intelligently ? And also , is it common practice around the world to blame the elected official for problems ?
